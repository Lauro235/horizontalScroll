The problem I had with this first method is that the items moved over to the right and I'm not sure how to bring them in line with the body margin again. I've noticed that bottom = left... And left = up. The orientation is way off and this hack doesn't seem to be going where I want it too.

I'll try another more JavaScript heavy method tomorrow and see where that takes me.
