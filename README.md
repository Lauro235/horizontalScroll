# Learn In Public Series

## horizontalScroll

### Goals and Intent

I would like to learn how to make a parallel scrolling website. I believe this is possible with CSS however I remember bumping into an instance where the parents width and height had to exactly match the width and height of it's children. This was a problem for me as I wanted the whole website to take up the whole of the browser window.

After my recent success in discovering how to apply a width and height to an element I thought I might be ready to give this a go. This project will be more JavaScript intensive as I hope to also use the button blur technique alongside the parallel scrolling idea...

Wish me luck!
